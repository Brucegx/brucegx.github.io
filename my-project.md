## **JavaScript Development**

### Snippetaas(On Process)
A co-operated program which aim to help programmers reuse snippets. A **full stack** project including **Database Design, back end server built, front end Design**. Now, we are building backend system in PostgreSQL - Sequelize - Node - Express - GraphQL tech stack. <a href="https://github.com/Brucegx/react-toolchain" title="Visit Website">Source Code</a>

### Simple Web Server Built
Project as a preparation for Snippetaas. Designed database schema in PostgreSQL and modelized to objects with RESTful. Built web server supporting easy data access from fornt-end side by Express.<a href="https://github.com/Brucegx/simple-node-sever" title="Visit Website">Source Code</a>

## **Network** 

### Soft-Defined-NetWork Constructure
Thought this project belongs to a my NYU course, I learned the concept of Software Defined Network and the skills of managing the SDN controller.

Built several different SDN structures by **Python**, flow control like drop, transfer and drop specific package by open virtual switches and openFlow switches. 

Implemented simple word count program with **Mapreduce** on **OpenStack**. <a href="https://github.com/Brucegx/Soft-Defined-Network" title="Visit Website">Source Code</a>

## **Manchine Learning**

### Implement Information Processing with Echo State Networks

Idea from a paper published in Natural Science. Achieved using a single dynamical node as ESN instead of traditional reservoir with fixed connections.

{% include media-image.html file="ESN structure.jpg" title="ESN structure" caption="Single node implement Echo State Network through adding delay in circle " %}

Evaluated model performance of classification via k-fold cross-validation by WEKA and got excellent performance in twotime series prediction benchmarks.
